    <p>Dear Ramesh,</p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How have you been? I hope you are doing good. What about your family? I hope they are also doing great! Well, I'm writing this letter to ask you why you are not coming to college for the last four days?
    </p>
    <p> Is everything stable? What's the matter? You are not in college for the last 4 days. I hope you don't have any illness. The class teacher was asking about you. As you know there was practical yesterday and you missed that too.
    </p>
    However, the teacher has told us that he will explain that practical once more. He has scheduled it for Monday. I hope till then you will come. And if you are not well then please inform me about your health. I'm waiting for your reply.   
    <p>Kindly Regard's</p>
    <p align="right">Yours faithfully,</p>
    <p align="right">SACHIN</p>
